It's understandable to get confused with the array of AWS service names, especially in the security and management domains. While some services might seem similar at first glance, they each serve distinct purposes within the AWS ecosystem.

Here's a table comparing the services you listed:

| **Feature** | **AWS Trusted Advisor** | **AWS Control Tower** | **Amazon GuardDuty** | **AWS Security Hub** | **AWS Firewall Manager** | **AWS Network Firewall** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Purpose** | Provides recommendations for cost optimization, performance improvement, security best practices, fault tolerance, and service quotas. | Sets up and governs a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on best practices. | Intelligent threat detection to protect your AWS accounts and workloads. | Provides a comprehensive view of your security state and helps manage security findings from various AWS services and partner products. | Centrally manages firewall rules across your AWS organization. | Highly available, managed network firewall service for your VPCs. |
| **Focus Area** | Proactive guidance and best practices across multiple pillars. | Account provisioning, governance, and compliance. | Threat detection and monitoring. | Centralized security posture management and finding aggregation. | Centralized firewall rule management. | Network traffic filtering at the VPC boundary. |
| **Key Capabilities** | Checks and recommendations in categories like Cost Optimization, Performance, Security, Fault Tolerance, and Service Limits. | Automates the setup of a landing zone, orchestrates multiple AWS services, and provides guardrails for compliance. | Analyzes various AWS data sources (e.g., VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail events, DNS logs) for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. | Aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes security findings from AWS services (like GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie) and AWS Partner solutions. Provides dashboards and compliance checks. | Deploys and manages AWS WAF rules, AWS Shield Advanced, and VPC security groups across accounts in an organization from a single administrator account. | Stateful inspection, intrusion prevention and detection, and web filtering for VPC network traffic. |
| **How it Helps** | Helps you optimize your AWS spend, improve application performance, enhance security posture, increase reliability, and stay within service limits. | Simplifies the process of setting up a well-architected multi-account environment, ensuring compliance and governance at scale. | Helps you identify potential security threats like cryptocurrency mining, |  |  |  |
| malicious activity, and compromised instances within your AWS environment. | Gives you a centralized view of your security alerts and compliance status, making it easier to prioritize and address security issues. | Simplifies the management of firewall rules across multiple accounts, ensuring consistent security policies are enforced organization-wide. | Provides fine-grained control over network traffic entering and leaving your VPCs, protecting against common network threats. |  |  |  |
| **Relationship to Others** | Offers broad recommendations, including some related to security that might be surfaced or complemented by Security Hub. | Provides the foundational multi-account structure and guardrails within which other security services operate. | A source of security findings that can be aggregated and managed within Security Hub. | Aggregates findings from GuardDuty, and can help identify areas where Firewall Manager or Network Firewall rules might be needed based on security posture. | Manages rules for firewalls, including potentially Network Firewall, across an organization. | A specific type of firewall managed by Firewall Manager and monitored by services like GuardDuty and Security Hub. |

In essence:

- **Trusted Advisor** is your general advisor for optimizing your AWS environment across several dimensions, including security.
- **Control Tower** is about setting up and governing your overall AWS multi-account structure securely.
- **GuardDuty** is your threat detection specialist, constantly monitoring for malicious activity.
- **Security Hub** is your security central command, aggregating and organizing findings from various security services.
- **Firewall Manager** is your central administrator for managing firewall rules across your organization.
- **Network Firewall** is the actual network traffic filtering service you deploy within your VPCs.

Understanding these distinct roles should help clarify how each service contributes to your overall AWS management and security strategy.

It appears you're looking for clarification on another set of AWS services with potentially similar-sounding names or functions. Here's a breakdown of Wavelength, DataSync, Transfer Family, Cost Explorer, Budgets, WorkSpaces, and AppStream to help you differentiate them:

| **Service** | **Primary Purpose** | **Key Features** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AWS Wavelength** | Brings AWS compute and storage services to the edge of telecommunication carriers' 5G networks. | Ultra-low latency to mobile devices and end-users, extends a VPC to Wavelength Zones, supports familiar AWS services (EC2, EBS, VPC). |
| **AWS DataSync** | Simplifies, automates, and accelerates online data transfer between on-premises storage and AWS storage services, and between AWS storage services. | Supports various sources and destinations (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3, EFS, FSx), automates data movement, provides encryption and integrity validation, offers scheduling and monitoring. |
| **AWS Transfer Family** | Provides fully managed support for file transfers directly into and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS using SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and AS2. | Managed file transfer service, supports multiple protocols, integrates with S3 and EFS, eliminates the need to manage file transfer servers. |
| **AWS Cost Explorer** | Allows you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. | Provides interactive graphs and reports, enables filtering and grouping by various dimensions, offers forecasting, and provides recommendations for Reserved Instances and Savings Plans. |
| **AWS Budgets** | Allows you to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount.**1** | Set cost, usage, RI utilization, and Savings Plans coverage budgets; configure alerts based on actual or forecasted values; supports various dimensions for filtering; can trigger actions when thresholds are breached. |
| **Amazon WorkSpaces** | A managed, secure Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution that allows you to provision virtual Windows and Linux desktops for your users. | Provides persistent cloud-based desktops, accessible from various devices, eliminates the need for managing hardware and VDI, offers different hardware and software bundles. |
| **Amazon AppStream 2.0** | A fully managed application streaming service that allows you to stream desktop applications securely to a web browser without rewriting them. | Delivers applications from the cloud, accessible from various devices via a web browser, centralize application management and updates, supports various instance types for streaming, offers different fleet types (Always-On, On-Demand, Elastic). |

Here's a simple way to think about their core differences:

- **Wavelength** is about **location and low latency** for edge computing.
- **DataSync** and **Transfer Family** are about **moving data**, but DataSync is for online transfers between various storage types, while Transfer Family is specifically for **file transfers using standard protocols** (SFTP, FTPS, etc.).
- **Cost Explorer** and **Budgets** are both about **managing costs**, but Cost Explorer is for **analyzing past and forecasted costs**, while Budgets is for **setting alerts and taking action** based on defined spending limits.
- **WorkSpaces** and **AppStream 2.0** are both about **delivering end-user computing**, but WorkSpaces provides a full **virtual desktop**, while AppStream streams individual **applications**.

Understanding whether a service is focused on networking, data transfer, cost management, or end-user computing can help you distinguish between them.

**AWS App Runner:** It's a fully managed AWS service for easily deploying containerized web apps and APIs from code or Docker images. It handles all the infrastructure stuff like servers, scaling, and load balancing, letting you focus on your code. Key benefits include automatic scaling, built-in security, CI/CD integration, and cost-effectiveness.

**Cross-Region Deployment with App Runner:** While App Runner is regional, you can achieve cross-region deployment for better availability and resilience. This involves deploying your application in multiple App Runner services across different AWS Regions. You'd typically use ECR cross-region replication for container images and AWS Route 53 for managing traffic across these regions. This setup improves uptime, resilience, and can reduce latency for users in different geographic locations, though it adds complexity and cost.

Route53, private hosted zones.

A small company has several AWS accounts that are used by multiple teams. To centralize DNS record keeping, the company has created a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53 on the main Account A. The new application and database servers are hosted on a VPC in Account B. The CNAME record set `db.turotialsdojo.com` has been created for the Amazon RDS endpoint on the private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53. Upon deployment, the application on the Amazon EC2 instances failed to start. The application logs indicate that the database endpoint `db.turotialsdojo.com` is not resolvable. However, the solutions architect can confirm that the Route 53 entry is configured correctly.

Which of the following options is the recommended solution for this issue? (Select TWO.)

**1, Create a VPC peering between the Account A VPC and Account B VPC. Configure the Amazon EC2 instances on Account B to use the DNS resolver IPs in Account A to resolve the Amazon RDS endpoint.**

**2, On Account B, associate the VPC to the private hosted zone in Account A. Delete the association authorization after the association is created.**

**3, Create custom AMI for the Amazon EC2 instances that have an updated /etc/resolv.conf file containing the Amazon RDS endpoint to private IP address mapping.**

**4, On Account B, create a new private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53. Associate this zone to the private hosted zone in Account A to allow replication between the AWS accounts.**

**5, On Account A, create an authorization to associate its private hosted zone to the new VPC in Account B.**

Private hosted zones are isolated within an account unless explicitly associated with VPCs in other accounts.

VPC peering alone does not automatically enable DNS resolution across private hosted zones in different accounts. While peering allows network traffic to flow between VPCs, DNS resolution for private hosted zones requires explicit association.

## Optimal Solution

The recommended solutions are:

1. **On Account B, associate the VPC to the private hosted zone in Account A. Delete the association authorization after the association is created.** This is the fundamental requirement for allowing resources within a VPC in one account to resolve records in a private hosted zone in another account. By associating the VPC in Account B with the private hosted zone in Account A, the DNS resolvers within the VPC in Account B will be able to query the private hosted zone in Account A. The authorization step in Account A is necessary to allow Account B to perform this association. Deleting the authorization after the association is created is a security best practice, as the association persists independently.
2. **On Account A, create an authorization to associate its private hosted zone to the new VPC in Account B.** Before Account B can associate its VPC with the private hosted zone in Account A, Account A needs to grant this permission. Creating an authorization in Account A allows Account B to complete the association. This step complements the first solution and is a prerequisite for it to work.

Public/private hosted zones are not created automatically.
We can have many private hosted zones in a VPC. 

Take note as well that the AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is primarily used to migrate virtual machines only, which can be from VMware vSphere and Windows Hyper-V to your AWS cloud. In addition, the AWS Application Discovery Service simply helps you to plan migration projects by gathering information about your on-premises data centers, but this service is not a suitable migration service.

**AWS Application Migration Service** minimizes time-intensive, error-prone manual processes by automatically converting your source servers to run natively on AWS. It also simplifies application modernization with built-in, post-launch optimization options.

- **Import VM Images:** AWS MGN can directly ingest and replicate the contents of the on-premises virtual machine disks to AWS. You don't need to manually convert them to AMIs first.
- **Synchronize Changes:** AWS MGN uses a continuous replication process. Once the initial sync is complete, it continuously replicates changes from the on-premises servers to the AWS environment in near real-time. This directly addresses the requirement for ongoing synchronization until the cutover.
- **Minimal Downtime Cutover:** AWS MGN allows for non-disruptive testing in AWS. You can launch test instances based on the replicated data without impacting the production environment on-premises. For the final cutover, you simply initiate a cutover process in MGN, which will stop the replication and launch the final production instances in AWS with minimal downtime.
- **Migrate Root and Data Volumes:** AWS MGN replicates all selected disks attached to the source VMs, including both the root volume and any data volumes, regardless of their size (including Terabytes of data).
- **Minimal Operational Overhead:** AWS MGN is a fully managed service designed for server migration. It handles the complexities of continuous replication, data transfer, and instance conversion, significantly reducing the operational overhead compared to manual scripting with VM Import/Export.
