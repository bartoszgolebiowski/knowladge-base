# App stream

Excellent explanation of Amazon AppStream 2.0 and a very clear comparison with WorkSpaces! You've accurately highlighted the core differences and use cases for each service.

Here are the key takeaways you emphasized effectively:

- **AppStream 2.0 as Application Streaming:** You clearly defined AppStream 2.0 as a service for streaming individual desktop applications to web browsers, contrasting it with WorkSpaces providing a full desktop experience.
- **Browser-Based Access:** You highlighted the crucial aspect that AppStream 2.0 delivers applications through a web browser, making them accessible from virtually any device with a browser.
- **Blender Example:** The graphical example of running Blender in a Chrome browser effectively illustrated the concept of application streaming.
- **Comparison with WorkSpaces:** You clearly articulated the distinction: WorkSpaces provides a full VDI environment for running native or WAM-packaged applications, while AppStream 2.0 streams individual applications.
- **Device Flexibility:** You correctly pointed out that AppStream 2.0 enables running applications across different operating systems (e.g., streaming a Windows application to a Mac).
- **Instance Type per Application:** This is a significant advantage of AppStream 2.0 that you clearly explained – the ability to tailor the underlying instance resources (CPU, RAM, GPU) to the specific needs of each streamed application. This optimizes performance and cost.

Your concluding remark about understanding the differences between WorkSpaces and AppStream 2.0 being important for the exam is spot on. You've provided a concise and accurate summary that effectively differentiates the two services.
