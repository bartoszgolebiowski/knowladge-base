# ACM

## **Purpose of ACM**

- Simplifies the process of provisioning, managing, and deploying SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services.
- Offers two ways to manage certificates:
    - Importing existing certificates.
    - Provisioning free public certificates managed and automatically renewed by ACM.

## **ACM Integrations**

ACM seamlessly integrates with various AWS services that require SSL/TLS certificates, including:

- Load Balancers (ALB, NLB, CLB via Elastic Beanstalk)
- CloudFront distributions
- APIs on API Gateway

## **How ACM Works with Load Balancers (ALB Example)**

1. **User Connection:** A user connects to the ALB via HTTPS.
2. **SSL Termination:** The ALB performs SSL/TLS termination. This means:
    - The encrypted HTTPS connection from the user is decrypted at the ALB.
    - A new, potentially unencrypted (HTTP) connection is opened between the ALB and the backend EC2 instances.
3. **ACM Provisioning:** ACM provisions and manages the SSL/TLS certificate(s) on the ALB. You don't need to manually handle certificate creation or renewal for ACM-provisioned certificates.
4. **Forwarding Requests:** The ALB forwards the decrypted HTTP requests to your EC2 instances (if configured for HTTP backend communication).
5. **Reduced EC2 Load:** Because SSL/TLS encryption and decryption happen at the ALB level, your EC2 instances experience less CPU overhead related to SSL.

## **Key Concepts for the Exam**

- **Public Certificates:**
    - Can be created and provisioned by ACM for free.
    - Require verification of public DNS ownership.
    - Must be issued by a trusted public Certificate Authority (ACM handles this).
    - ACM automatically handles renewal for these certificates.
- **Private Certificates:**
    - Used for internal applications.
    - You can create your own private CA (Certificate Authority) using ACM Private CA.
    - Applications must be configured to trust your private CA certificate.
    - Certificates issued by your private CA are not publicly trusted.
- **Certificate Renewal:**
    - **ACM-provisioned public certificates:** Automatically renewed by ACM.
    - **Manually uploaded certificates:** You are responsible for manually renewing these certificates before they expire.
- **Regional Service:**
    - **ACM is a regional service.** This is a **very important** point.
    - Certificates provisioned in one AWS region cannot be directly used in another region.
    - For global applications with resources in multiple regions (e.g., ALBs in different regions), you need to provision an SSL/TLS certificate using ACM in **each** region where the resource requiring the certificate is deployed.
    - You cannot copy ACM certificates across regions.
- **CloudFront Exception:** CloudFront is a global service. When configuring HTTPS for a CloudFront distribution, you can associate an ACM certificate that was provisioned in the **US East (N. Virginia) region**, regardless of where your origin is located. CloudFront will then distribute the certificate globally to its edge locations. However, for regional resources like ALBs, the regionality of ACM applies.

In summary, ACM greatly simplifies SSL/TLS certificate management in AWS, especially for public-facing applications. Remember the distinction between public and private certificates, the automatic renewal for ACM-provisioned certificates, and the crucial fact that **ACM is a regional service** with the exception of certificates used with CloudFront distributions.
